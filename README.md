In November 2021, the BBC Shared Data Unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-59067101) around 100 people who were denied fast-tracked disability benefits for terminal illness had died challenging the decision since 2018.

Under rules in effect at the time, patients could access benefits more quickly if their clinician says they had six months or less to live.

In July 2021 the government had promised to extend that to 12 months. Critics said it did not go far enough.

"Our priority is dealing with people's claims quickly and compassionately," the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said.

Figures released to the BBC Shared Data Unit under the Freedom of Information Act had previously revealed [more than 1,000 more people across the UK had died while formally challenging their benefit decision](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-58284613).

In July 2021 [we had also reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-57726608) how the DWP had held at least 268 internal reviews into cases where people claiming benefits died or came to serious harm since February 2012. The Labour Party then called for an "urgent independent investigation".
